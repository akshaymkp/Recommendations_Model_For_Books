# Recommendations model for books uisng Knn and NLP methods on books description and reviews

The e-commerce boom has increased competition in the online world. One of the competitive advantages that online businesses want is a tailored experience for their customers. To provide a fully tailored experience, users and their behaviors must be learnt. Recommender systems can be used to customize website content for each individual visitor. User interactions across various channels feed a recommender system, which improves the precision of recommendations and gives users a more personalized experience. 
In this project, we are going to walk through the approach of building a recommendation system for books based on content based filtering. 
We will first analyse the data to gain some understanding and get insights like leading authors, most liked books etc. We will then see how to build the model using the knn method based on cosine similarity. We will start out by using fields like - author, top 5 genres voted by customers and rating to get similarity scores between 2 books. To further enhance the model, we will add similarity between book descriptions using the bag of words method and generated 10 recommendations for every user given input. We will also experiment with the same model (knn using nlp analysis) on the reviews of books and generate recoomendations by varying number of features and n-grams.
